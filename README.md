# msg in a bottle

'msg in a bottle' is a small React app that utilizes the API of [file.io](https://file.io) to enable users to send text messages that will be destroyed right after being read once. According to the creators of file.io, they're not logging any contents â€“ neither does 'msg in a bottle'.

The app was created during my time at [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com) to learn about patterns that combine the Context API with the useReducer hook, in this case for data fetching.
